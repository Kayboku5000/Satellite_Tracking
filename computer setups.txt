I have multiple machines, I built them for running multiple projection setups. 
(they have all been installed in various venues, I just dont have any out at the moment)
They all have 1200 watt PSUs, so they can handle running any amount of graphics cards, 
(parts get swapped around a lot, depending on whats happening).
The 2 i7s have the 2011-3 pin design, it was one of the only systems that had 40 channels of PCI, instead of 16.
(im sure one is actually a xeon, or maybe both, as they were designed to run 24 hours a day, but windows is saying i7.)
All have multiple ssds, huge cooling fans etc, all the fruit for a beasty machine!
